ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m Brandon and I've been learning to code in my spare time over the past few years. I enjoy working with Python and Javascript (controversial, I know), but I'm happy to learn any language if it's the right tool for the job. I wish I would've learned to code earlier in life, but I guess it's never too late :)

ðŸ”—  Here's a link to [my portfolio](https://www.lightmattr.com/) if you're interested in checking out some of my work!
